As dotLess is of abysmal quality, this repository contains some bug fixes. I won't be wasting my time with PRs as they have > 100 issues open and seem rather inactive.

- Fixed all imports being marked as 'once'
- Manhandled the build to work for our purposes

What follows is the original dotLess README:

Just Want a .dll?
=================

If you don't care about the source and just want a .dll you can get a compiled release from [Github](https://github.com/dotless/dotless/downloads).

Simply select for the latest successful build and click on the "Artifacts" section, here you'll find the latest compiler exe and any dll's required.


Whats this all about?
---------------------

This is a project to port the hugely useful Less libary to the .NET world. 
It give variables, nested rules and operators to CSS.
